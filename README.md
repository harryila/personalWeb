# Personal Web Template

This repository contains a minimal static website template you can customize for your personal site. It includes a simple blog section and a clean, professional style suitable for showcasing software engineering or machine learning projects.

## Structure

- `website/index.html` – Home page
- `website/about.html` – About page
- `website/blog/index.html` – Blog overview
- `website/blog/posts/` – Folder for individual blog posts
- `website/css/style.css` – Basic styles

## Getting Started

Open `website/index.html` in your browser to preview the site. Edit the HTML and CSS files to add your own content, adjust colors, or integrate your favorite framework.

You can deploy the `website` folder to any static hosting provider (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel).
