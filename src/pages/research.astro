        My research spans the intersection of machine learning efficiency, optimization theory, and societal impact. I focus on developing practical solutions that bridge theoretical foundations with real-world applications, particularly in model compression, safety-aligned AI systems, and data-driven approaches to social challenges.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        Through interdisciplinary collaboration and rigorous experimentation, I aim to advance our understanding of how AI systems can be made more efficient, reliable, and beneficial to society while maintaining strong theoretical foundations.
