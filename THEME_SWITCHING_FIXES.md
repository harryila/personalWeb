# Theme Switching Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Inverted Main Toggle (Critical)**
- **Problem**: In `src/settings.ts`, `lightTheme` was set to `'dark'` instead of `'light'`, causing the main theme toggle to be inverted.
- **Fix**: Changed `lightTheme: 'dark'` to `lightTheme: 'light'` and `darkTheme: 'light'` to `darkTheme: 'dark'`.

### 2. **Conflicting Theme Systems**
- **Problem**: The main `DarkLightController` was using DaisyUI's `data-choose-theme` attribute while the palette system was using custom events, causing conflicts.
- **Fix**: Updated `DarkLightController.astro` to use the same custom event system as the palette toggles.

### 3. **Unsynchronized Toggles**
- **Problem**: The main navigation toggle and palette page toggles weren't properly synchronized.
- **Fix**: Implemented a unified event system with `themeToggled`, `paletteChanged`, and `modeToggled` events.

### 4. **Theme Library Conflicts**
- **Problem**: Both the custom theme system and DaisyUI's `themeChange` library were running simultaneously, causing conflicts.
- **Fix**: Removed the `themeChange` library import from `Head.astro` since we're using our own enhanced system.

## How It Works Now

### Main Navigation Toggle
- Works with both default themes (light/dark) and selected palettes
- Automatically switches between the light and dark versions of the currently selected palette
- Persists state across page navigation and refreshes

### Palette System
- Selecting a palette applies it immediately in light mode
- Individual palette toggles switch between light/dark modes for that specific palette
- All toggles stay synchronized across the website
- Selected palettes persist across sessions

### Event System
- `paletteChanged`: Fired when a new palette is selected
- `modeToggled`: Fired when switching between light/dark modes
- `themeToggled`: Fired when the main toggle is used
- All components listen for these events to stay synchronized

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Behavior**: All theme toggles now work as expected
2. **Persistence**: Theme selections persist across navigation and page refreshes
3. **Synchronization**: All toggles throughout the site stay in sync
4. **No Conflicts**: Removed competing theme systems
5. **Enhanced UX**: Smooth theme switching with proper visual feedback

## Testing

The theme switching now works correctly:
- ✅ Main navigation toggle switches between light/dark modes
- ✅ Palette toggles work independently and stay synchronized
- ✅ Selected palettes persist across page navigation
- ✅ Theme state is maintained after browser refresh
- ✅ No conflicts between different theme systems
